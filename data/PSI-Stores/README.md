# PSI stores

This folder contains the Microsoft PSI stores with the gaze and blink data and distracted/inattentive data.

The GazeBlinkData store is generated by the OpenFace post-processing script. The original store with recorded webcam data is sensitive data but can be shared upon reasonable request.

The Distraction store contains streams with all deblur times and distraction button presses from experiment 2b. It also contains a stream of inattentive events, which were generated when a deblur time was higher than 2900 ms.
